Set Up


If you have create a React App using create-react-app then this comes complete with Jest, a test runner built and maintained by Facebook.


To install Enzyme, run the following:


yarn add -D enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json

Then create a file called src/setupTests.js that contains the following:

import { configure } from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
