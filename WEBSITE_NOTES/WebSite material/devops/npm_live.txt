Enhance the Deployment Process

NPM offers an option which allows to only install app dependencies required for production environment. Use one of the following commands to skip the devDependencies in your package.json.

npm install --production  

or

NODE_ENV=production npm install  

Both options will do the job for you. The first one passes the --production flag to NPM. The second sets the node environment variable NODE_ENV to production. NPM recognizes this variable and considers it before executing the npm install command.

Additionally, you can reduce the log levels to just show warnings:

npm install --loglevel warn
