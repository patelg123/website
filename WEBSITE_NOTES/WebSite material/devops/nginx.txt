<h1>NGINX</h1>

NGINX, pronounced as engine-X is a popular web server that also doubles as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. 


runs on multiple environments including Unix, Linux, BSD variants, MacOS, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Windows


NGINX supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP, and others).


 NGINX uses a more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) architecture, instead of relying on thread-based request handling system, making it efficient to handle more requests per second without compromising on speed.



Features of NGINX

    Low memory footprint
    Ability to handle more than 10,000 simultaneous connections
    Handling of static files, index files and auto-indexing
    Reverse proxy with caching
    Load balancing
    IPv6-compatible
    Name-based and IP-based virtual servers
    The PUT, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, and MOVE methods
    FLV and MP4 streaming
    Response rate limiting

    Embedded Perl

These are just a few of the features of NGINX, you can check out a complete breakdown of its features <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">here</a>.


Open source written specifically to solve scaling issues.

Uses an event-driven, asynchronous and non-blocking approach. 

Allows setting multiple porcesses and each worker can handle thousands of concurrent connections.
