Introduction:

Minification is primarily useful for decreasing the size of the JavaScript payload sent from the server to the client: users will download less code to use your website.



Minification is used for decreasing the size of the JavaScript payload sent from the server to the client. 

Minification removes unnecessary characters from a program without changing its functionality – things like comments, whitespace, newlines, and extra parentheses. 

Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.


You should minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources: 


To minify HTML, HTMLMinifier can be used. (https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)


To minify CSS, CSSNano can be used.

To minify JavaScript Babel-minify 




Babel-minify:

Instead of using Bable to compile ES6 code down to ES5  to support older browsers then using Uglify to minimise the code, we can just use Babel-minify.
