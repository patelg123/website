      <h1>Docker</h1>
      <p>
        Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers .You can think of Docker as an operating system (or runtime) for Docker containers.
        It allows anyone to package an application on their laptop, which in turn can run unmodified on any public cloud, private cloud, or even bare metal. The mantra is: "build once, run anywhere."
        The Docker Engine is installed on each server you want to run containers on and provides a simple set of commands you can use to build, start, or stop Docker Containers.
      </p>

      <h2>Docker Images</h2>
      <p>
        Docker images are read-only templates that describe a Docker Container. They include specific instructions written in a <b>Dockerfile</b> that defines the application and its dependencies.
        You can think of Docker images as a snapshot of an application at a certain time. You will get images when you run the <b>docker build</b> command.
      </p>
      <h2>Docker Containers</h2>
      <p>
        Docker containers are built off Docker images and wraps an application’s software into an invisible box with everything the application needs to run.
        They include the operating system, application code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, etc. Since images are read-only, Docker adds a read-write file system
        over the read-only file system of the image to create a container.
        <br><br>
        Docker containers are very lightweight and fast. Since containers are just sandboxed environments running on the kernel, they take up fewer resources.
        You can create and run a Docker container in seconds, compared to VMs which might take longer because they have to boot up a full virtual operating system every time.
        <br><br>
        You are able to connect multiple Docker Containers together. For example, you might have your Postgres database running in one container and your Redis server in another
        while your Node.js app is in another. With Docker, it’s become easier to link these containers together to create your application, making it easy to scale or update components
        independently in the future.
        <br><br>
        You can  run a Docker Container with <b>docker start</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Docker Registries</h2>
      <p>
          A Docker Registry is a place for you to store and distribute Docker images.
          <br><br>
          Docker's own registry is called <b>Docker Hub</b> which is a sort of 'app store for Docker images'. It has has tens of thousands of public images created by the community that are readily available for use.
          It’s incredibly easy to search for images that meet your needs, ready to pull down and use with little-to-no modification.
      </p>

      <h2>Docker Compose</h2>
      <p>
          Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to build and start multiple Docker Images at once.
          Instead of running the same multiple commands every time you want to start your application, you can do them all in one command — once you provide a specific configuration.
      </p>

      <h2>How to get code into containers</h2>

      <h3>Using Shared Volumes</h3>
      <p>
        Docker allows for mounting local directories into containers using the shared volumes feature.
        Just use the -v switch to specify the local directory path that you wish to mount, along with the location where it should be mounted within the running container
        <br><br>
        This is particularly useful when developing locally, as you can use your favorite editor to work locally, commit code to Git, and pull the latest code from remote branches.
        Your application will run inside a container, isolating it away from any processes you have running on your development laptop.
      </p>

      <h3>Using COPY command</h3>
      <p>
        You can use the COPY command within a Dockerfile to copy files from the local filesystem into a specific directory within the container.
        This technique is recommended for building production-ready Docker images.
      </p>

      <h1>Redux</h1>
      <p>
        Redux is a tool for managing application state and is a very common tool used in React applications.
        State is a collection of application data, like the current logged in user’s name.
        The state for an application might change based on things such as user actions or a response from an API.
        An application will read the state to determine what sort of User Interface it should show.
        <br><br>
        React does have local component state but as a React application grows and becomes more complex, like when functions
        that change application state are scattered through several React components, it may be a good idea to start to use Redux.
      </p>

      <p>
        React has ‘unidirectional data flow’ which means components send state downwards as props.
        <br>
        <img src="images/react_unidirectional_flow.gif" alt="React Unidirectional Flow" />
        <br>
        As a React application grows more complex, some components may need to share state but they don't share a parent-child relationship.
        To get around this issue, you can use a technique called 'Lifting state' which means the state (and functions that change this state) are
        lifted to the closet ancestor (Container Component). The child component can trigger state changes in their parent components, which will update all other components in the tree.
        <br>
        <img src="images/lifting_state_simple.gif" alt="Simple Lifting State" />
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as the application starts to get more complex, the the way state is being updated and dispersed across our application is may become more complex
        and the application state flow may start looking like the below:
        <br>
        <img src="images/complex_application_state_flow.gif" alt="Complex State Application State Flow" />
        <br>
        When developing your application it may be worth considering Redux if:
        <ul>
          <li>State doesn’t always flow in a linear, unidirectional way and you find that the functions that changed state are spread across multiple components</li>
          <li>You are passing the same props through multiple levels of components</li>
          <li>Many unrelated components update state in the same way.</li>
          <li>The UI can vary significantly based on application state.</li>
          <li>It is becoming harder to trace state changes when debugging an application.</li>
          <li>State is updated in many different ways.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>How Redux works</h2>
      <p>
        Redux allows you to maintain the application state as a single global store, rather than in local component state.
        Not all React applications need to use Redux and simple React applications won't benefit from it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redux has the following structure:

        <ul>
          <li><b>Actions:</b> Static information about the event that initiates a state change. </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reducers:</b> A pure function that describes how each action updates the store. When an action is dispatched it is sent to the reducer.
            A key point to remember is that the reducer will always return a new application state. It will never directly mutate the store.
          </li>
          <li><b>Store:</b> The application state stored as objects. React components can subscribe to the store and whenever the store is updated, it will update the components.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
      <h2>Computing Service Models</h2>
      <h3>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h3>
      <p>
        With IaaS, pre-configured hardware resources are provided to users through a virtual interface.
        Implementation of applications, and even the operating system, is left up to the customer. It simply
        enables access to the infrastructure needed to power or support that software.
      </p>
      <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
      <p>
        PaaS provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet.
        PaaS offerings typically include a base operating system and a suite of applications and development tools.
        The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.
        <br><br>
        PaaS solutions provide a platform that allows customers to develop, launch, and manage apps in a way that is much simpler than having to build and maintain the infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes referred to as ‘on-demand software’, SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model where a fully functional and
        complete software product  is delivered to users over the web on a subscription basis.
        <br><br>
        SaaS offerings are typically accessed by end users through a web browser (making the user’s operating system largely irrelevant)
        and can be billed  based on consumption or, more simply, with a flat monthly charge.
        <br><br>
        Popular products like Office365 and Salesforce have thrust SaaS offerings to the forefront of the workplace and are used by thousands
        of businesses every day.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparing cloud service and traditional on-premises infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a scenario where a development team is tasked to develop a new service for a global enterprise company that currently serves millions of consumers worldwide.
        The new service must:
        <ul>
          <li>have the ability to scale to meet peak data demands</li>
          <li>provide resiliency in the event of a datacenter failure</li>
          <li>Ensure data is secure and protected</li>
          <li>Provide in-depth debugging for troubleshooting</li>
          <li>The project must be delivered quickly</li>
          <li>The service be cost-efficient to build and maintain</li>
        </ul>
        Below is a comparison of building it on on-premises infrastructure and building it using AWS cloud infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        With on-premises infrastructure, the compute capacity needs to sized to match peak data demands. If the service has a large variable workload, it will
        leave you with a lot of excess and expensive compute capacity in times of low utilization, which can be seen as wasteful.
        Also there is the operational costs for supporting a rack of bare-metal servers for a single service.
        <br><br>
        With a cloud based infrastructure an <b>auto scaling</b> solution you can define seamless auto scaling groups that spin up more instances of the application
        based on demand. This means that you’re only paying for the compute resources that you use.
      </p>
      <h3>Resiliency</h3>
      <p>
        To meet basic resiliency criteria, hosting a service within a single datacentre is not an option.
        For an on-premises solution, this team would a minimum of two servers for local resiliency — replicated in a second data center for geographic redundancy.
        A load balancing solution also needs to be implemented that automatically redirects traffic between sites in the event of saturation or failure and it needs to
        be ensured that the mirror sites are continually synchronised with each other.
        <br><br>
        AWS provide multiple availability zones within each of their 50 regions worldwide with automated failover capabilities that can seamlessly transition AWS services to other
        zones within the region. The AWS load balancer requires minimal effort to setup and manage the traffic flow.
      </p>

      <h3>Security and protection of data</h3>
      <p>
        For the on-premises solution, there will be the an ongoing cost of monitoring, identifying and patching security threats.
        For the cloud based solution, the development team still have to be vigilant but don’t have to worry about patching the underlying infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>Monitoring and logging</h3>
      <p>
        Infrastructure and application services need to be monitored and ideally have access to a dashboard that provides alerts when thresholds are exceeded and
        offer the ability to easily access and search logs for trouble shooting. This can be very diffucult to set up on the on-premises solution and developers
        may find themselves searching through log files located on different servers.
        <br><br>
        Native AWS services such as CloudWatch and CloudTrail make monitoring cloud applications easy with the cloud based solution. Without much setup,
        the development team can monitor a wide variety of different metrics for each of the deployed services.
      </p>

      <h2>Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>

      <h3>Downtime</h3>
      <p>
        As the cloud requires an internet connection to work, if your connection is running slowly or is down, it will affect your work as you will not be able to
        access any of your applications, server or data. If your internet service suffers from frequent outages or slow speeds, cloud computing may not be  suitable for your business.
        <br><br>
        As cloud service providers take care of a number of clients each day, they can become overwhelmed and may even come up against technical outages themselves.
        Even the most reliable cloud computing service providers suffer server outages now and again.
        <br><br>
        This is why it is important to choose a reliable cloud services provider, because even if an outage occurs, you can be sure your provider will try and resolve the problem as soon as possible.
        With the right provider, cloud computing is still much more reliable and consistent than an in-house IT infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Cloud based solutions are exposed on the public internet and so a more vulnerable target for malicious users and hackers.
        Nothing on the Internet is completely secure and even the biggest organisations can suffer from serious attacks and security breaches.
        <br><br>
        Also by using cloud-based services, a company is essentially 'outsourcing' its data so trusting the provider to effectively manage and safeguard their data.
        It is therefore essential that a trusted, experienced and reliable provider with a  proven track record is chosen.
        <br><br>
        Many cloud experts however believe that trusted cloud data centres, such as Amazon Web, have better security than an in-house data centre, so security is really dependent  upon the provider.
      </p>

      <h3>Vendor Lock-in</h3>
      <p>
        Differences between provider systems can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to migrate from one provider to another.
        Not only can it be complex and expensive to reconfigure your applications to meet the requirements of a new  host, it can be really painful and
        cumbersome to transfer huge data from the old provider to the new one and you could also expose your data to additional security and privacy vulnerabilities.
        <br><br>
        Be careful when you're choosing a cloud computing vendor that you're not going to become a "forever" customer because their applications and/or data formats do not allow easy
        transfer/conversion of information into other systems. Some vendors deliberately attempt to "lock-in" customers by using proprietary software/hardware,
        so that it is impossible or very expensive to switch to another cloud vendor.
      </p>

      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>
          For a small to medium size business, cloud computing could be a lot cheaper to have than having in-house servers. However, if your business is very large such as on
          corporate level, the benefits of cloud computing dwindles as the cost skyrockets. Be sure to analyse the cost for both an in-house server and the cloud before making a
          decision for your business.
          <br><br>
          You should look closely at the pricing plans and details for each application, taking into account possible future expansion. For example, the president of a non-profit
          organization that recently switched to a cloud-based membership application found that when their membership numbers recently exceeded the limits on their contract the price
           to go to the next tier was nearly double.
          <br><br>
          If you don't need the most up-to-date versions of software every year, desktop software can be cheaper in the long run. For instance, if you purchase the desktop
          version of Microsoft Office 2016 and use it for several years, you pay a one-time fee and own the software forever versus having to pay an annual fee for using the cloud-based version,
          Office 365.
          <br><br>
          If your business involves transferring large amounts of data, be aware that while transferring data to the cloud (inbound) is free, outbound data transfers over the basic monthly allowance
          are charged on a per GB basis. If your business requirements will include regularly downloading large amounts of data from your cloud applications or data storage, the additional
          costs can add up. (See, for example, Microsoft Azure data transfer pricing.)

      <h1>Pollyfills and Transpilers</h1>
      <p>
        Transpilers take the <b>syntax</b> that older browsers don't understand (e.g. classes, 'const', arrow functions)
        and turn them into syntax that they will understand (functions, 'var', functions).
        <br /><br />
        A polyfill is a type of shim that defines a new <b>object or method</b> in browsers that don't support that object or
        method (e.g. Array.prototype.includes, Map, Promise).
        <br /><br />
        You can find a lot of what you will ever need in babel-polyfill or more specifically: <a href="https://github.com/zloirock/core-js">core-js</a>

      <h1>Cross Browser Testing</h1>
      <p>
        There is no way you can test on every combination of browser and device but instead you should try and make sure your site works on the most important target browsers and devices.
        <br /><br />
        You should try and code "defensively" and build in intelligent fall-backs so that if a feature or style doesn't work in a browser, the site will be able to downgrade to something
        less exciting that still provides an acceptable user experience.
        <br /><br />
        You can build up a chart of browsers and/devices and a common approach is to have multiple grades of support level. Fro example:
        <ul>
          <li>A grade: Common/modern browsers — known to be capable. Test thoroughly and provide full support.</li>
          <li>B grade: Older/less capable browsers — known not to be capable. Test, and provide a more basic experience that gives full access to core information and services.</li>
          <li>C grade: Rare/unknown browsers — don't test, but assume they are capable. Serve the full site, which should work, at least with the fallbacks provided by our defensive coding.</li>
        </ul>
        So, if you site is likely to get most views in Western Europe or North America, your chart could look like the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A grade: Chrome and Firefox for Windows/Mac, Safari for Mac, Edge and IE for Windows (last two versions of each), iOS Safari for iPhone/iPad, Android stock browser (last two versions)
            on phone/tablet, Chrome and Firefox for Android (last two versions) on phone/tablet
          </li>
          <li>B grade: IE 9 for Windows.</li>
          <li>C grade: n/a</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> will give you accurate stats on exactly what browsers people are using to browse your site.
        Analytics history can be useful for finding support stats to influence say a new version of a company's site, or new features you are adding to an existing site.

      <h1>Website accessibility</h1>
      <p>
        Accessibility should be considered as part of every web project. As well as increasing availability to the widest possible audience,
        it is a legal requirement in many countries. In the UK for example, web accessibility falls under the Disability Discrimination Act
        and if your website fails to comply, legal action could be brought against you.
      </p>

      <h2>Some ways to improve accessibilty</h2>

      <h3>Colours and contrast</h3>
      <p>
        Contrast ratio between the text and the background should be considered to increase readability. You can check the contrast ratio of multiple elements on a site using
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/wcag-contrast-checker/">Juicy Studio’s Color Contrast Analyser Firefox extension</a>.
        It will analyse each element on the page and provide a report on whether or not it conforms to the WAI’s guidelines.
        <br /><br />
        A simple text link, styled red with no other decoration may be hard to see if it is within a block of grey or black text.
        You don’t need to stick with default link styling, but it is helpful to use more than one type of decoration such as an underline or background-color.
        A useful tool can be found at  <a href=https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter>Colorblind Web Page Filter</a>
        which provides several different filters that mimic how different types of colour-blind users would perceive a website.
      </p>
      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>
        Images should all have descriptive <b>alt</b>  text unless they are purely decorative where they should have either empty <b>alt</b> text or should be set as a CSS background image.
      </p>
      <h3>Site Navigation</h3>
      <p>
        All page functionality should be available using just the keyboard. When a user tabs through the web page, make sure that each section can be reached, and all possible user actions
        can be performed with the keyboard. The user should be able to navigate your site freely, without getting stuck in a loop, where they cannot navigate out or away.
        <br /><br />
        By default, the order you list your elements on the page will be order of navigation. If you wish to change the order without changing the page structure,
        you can add tabindex on the element of your choice, and assign a number value to indicate the order in which this element should receive focus.
        <br /><br />
        Links with an empty href attribute (or href="#") are not accessible by keyboard. This pattern is sometimes used in dropdown menus, etc. but because the links do not lead anywhere
        (they link to the current page) they are ignored in keyboard navigation.
        <br /><br />
        Alt text for links should be included and a concise descriptor that clearly describes where the link leads should be chosen instead of ambiguous language like “click here”.
        If there is a validation error on any form field input, suggestions for how to correct the error should be provided to the user.
        All form inputs should have appropriate labels to indicate their purpose.
        <br /><br />
        Users that use screen readers will often have the option to navigate a web page by skipping through the links to find something of interest.
        In the case of text links, the user would simply hear the word in isolation, regardless of the content that surrounds it. It is therefore extremely
        unhelpful when all that the user hears is ‘click here’ or ‘more’ – these types of links provide no information of where they direct the user or to what they are referring to.
        A much better option is to provide a more descriptive link.  E.g. ‘learn more about S.E.O’ or ‘click here for the full article on S.E.O’.
      <p>
      <h3>Focus Indicators</h3>
      <p>
        All links, buttons, form fields, tool tips, menu items, etc. should include a focus indicator to allow users to navigate through your site with a keyboard.
        If you want to have control over when the focus indicator appears (for instance, only for keyboard users), the page
        <a href="https://hackernoon.com/removing-that-ugly-focus-ring-and-keeping-it-too-6c8727fefcd2"> Removing that ugly :focus ring (and keeping it too) </a> outlines how to achieve this effect.

      </p>
      <h3>Skip Navigation Links</h3>
      <p>
          If a page contained a side bar with loads of links, without a skip navigation link, people using just the keyboard or screen readers  to navigate would need to tab
          through each link in the sidebar every time the page reloads. Since there’s a lot links available, navigating through this section would be cumbersome.
          A skip navigation link is usually the first item in the DOM (Document Object Model) and when clicked, the keyboard focus is sent to the page element which contains
          the primary content of the page.

      <p>
        A Pipeline in Jenkins is a way of defining some Jenkins steps using code, and automate the process of deploying software.
        The list of jobs which are to be performed in the pipeline is configured in the <b>Jenkinsfile</b>, which is a

        The Bitbucket plugin <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.nerdwin15.stash-stash-webhook-jenkins/server/overview">Webhook to Jenkins for Bitbucket</a>
        can be used to Integrate Bitbucket Server and Jenkins and allows you to configure a hook on a project or repository level.

      <h1>GIT Work Flows</h1>
      <p>
        Git offers a lot of flexibility and there is no standardized process on how to interact with Git. When working
        with a team on a Git managed project, it’s important to make sure the team is on the “same page” with regards to
        which Git workflow should be used. Below are several publicized Git workflows that may be a good fit for your team.
      </p>

      <h2>Git Feature Branch Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The core idea with this workflow is that all development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the <b>master</b> branch.
        <br /><br />
        It allows the usage of <b>pull requests</b> which allows developers to comment on each other’s work before it gets integrated into the main project.
      </p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of working and committing directly on their local <b>master</b> branch, developers create a new branch every time they start a work on a new  item.
        The branches should have descriptive names to allow easy identification e.g. issue#865.
        <br /><br />
        Once work has been completed on the branch, the branch can be pushed to the central repository where the code can be reviewed by other developers without it
        touching the 'official' code in the master branch.
      </p>
      <h3>Simple Walk through example:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Create a new branch</b>
        <br />
        Use a separate branch for each work item. Run the below to create and switch to (checkout to) the newly created branch:
      </p>
      <pre>
git checkout -b new-feature
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>Update, add, commit</b>
        <br />
        On this branch, edit, stage and commit changes as you would usually do:
      </p>
      <pre>
git add <some-files>
git commit
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>Push feature branch to remote</b>
        <br />
        The below command pushes new-feature to the central repository (origin), and the -u flag adds it as a remote tracking branch.
        After setting up the tracking branch, git push can be invoked without any parameters to automatically push the new-feature branch to the central repository.
      </p>
      <pre>
git push -u origin new-feature
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>Feedback</b>
        <br />
        To get feedback on the new feature branch, create a pull request in Bitbucket or GitHub. This allows teammates to comment on the branch pushed commit.
        Resolve their comments locally, then commit and push the suggested changes. Your updates appear in the pull request.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Merge Pull request</b>
        <br />
        When your pull request is approved and conflict-free, you can add your code to the master branch. Merge from the pull request in Bitbucket or GitHub.
        This can also be manually done by running the following:
      </p>
      <pre>
git checkout master
git pull
git pull origin new-feature
git push
      </pre>

      <h2>Gitflow Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.
        It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.
        <br /><br />
        There is a <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">git-flow toolset</a> available which integrates
        with Git to provide specialized Gitflow Git command line tool extensions.
      </p>

      <h3>Gitflow Branches</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of a single <b>master</b> branch, two branches are used to record the history of a project.
        The <b>master</b> branch stores the official release history, and the <b>develop</b> branch serves as an integration branch.
        <br /><br />
        Each new feature of a project should have its own branch and use <b>develop</b> as their parent branch; and should never  interact directly with <b>master</b>.
        When you’ve finished with the development work on the feature, the next step is to merge the feature_branch into develop.
        Once the develop branch has acquired enough features for a release, or a predetermined release date is approaching, you fork a <b>release</b> branch
        off of develop.
        <br /><br />
        Once created, no new features can be added to the <b>release</b> branch, only bug fixes, documentation and other release task related items.
        Once it is ready to ship, the release branch is merged into master and tagged with a version number and also be merged back into develop which
        may have progressed since the release was initiated. Once this has been done, the release branch is then deleted.
      </p>
      <h3>Maintenance Branches</h3>
      <p>
        Maintenance or “hotfix” branches branch off of the master branch rather than develop. As soon as a fix is complete it should be
        merged into both  master and develop (or the current release branch). You can think of maintenance branches as ad hoc release branches that work directly with master.
        <br /><br />
        Below is the overall flow of Gitflow:
        <ul>
          <li>A develop branch is created from master</li>
          <li>A release branch is created from develop</li>
          <li>Feature branches are created from develop</li>
          <li>When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch</li>
          <li>When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master</li>
          <li>If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master</li>
          <li>Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="images/gitflow.svg" alt="Gitflow workflow" />

      <h2>Forking Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        This workflow is most often seen in public open source projects.
        It  gives the developer their own server-side (remote) repository which means two Git repositories: a private local
        one and a public server  side one. While you can call these remotes anything you want, a common convention
        is to use <b>origin</b> as the remote for your forked repository (this  will be created automatically when you run git clone)
        and <b>upstream</b> for the official repository.
        <br /><br />
        Developers push to their own server-side repositories, and only the project maintainer can push to the official repository.
        This allows the  maintainer to accept commits from any developer without giving them write access to the official codebase.
        <br /><br />
        When a developer wants to start working on a project, they fork (which is essentially just a git clone command
        executed on a server copy of a  projects repo.) the official repository to create a copy of it on the server.
        Popular Git hosting services like GitHub and Bitbucket, offer repo forking features that automate this step.
        This new copy serves as their personal public repository — no other developers are allowed to push to it, but they can pull changes from it.
        <br /><br />
        The developer performs a git clone to get a copy of it onto their local machine. When they're ready to publish a local commit,
        they push the commit to their own public repository—not the official one. Then, they file a pull  request with the main repository,
        which lets the project maintainer know that an update is ready to be integrated. The pull request also serves as a
        convenient discussion thread if there are issues with the contributed code.
        <br /><br />
        To integrate the feature into the official codebase, the maintainer pulls the contributor’s changes into their local repository,
        checks to make sure it doesn’t break the project, merges it into their local master branch, then pushes the master branch to the official repository on the server.
        The contribution is now part of the project, and other developers should pull from the official repository to synchronize their local repositories.
        <br /><br />
        The Forking Workflow helps a maintainer of a project open up the repository to contributions from any developer without having to manually manage
        authorization settings for each individual contributor. This gives the maintainer more of a "pull" style workflow.
        <br /><br />
        Most commonly used in open-source projects, the Forking Workflow can also be applied to private business workflows to give more authoritative
        control over what is merged into a release. This can be useful in teams that have Deploy Managers or strict release cycles.

      <h1>REST</h1>
      <p>
        REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses simple HTTP calls for inter-machine (Client and Server) communication.
        Clients and servers can interact in complex ways without the client knowing anything beforehand about the server and the resources it hosts.
        The key constraint is that the server and client must both agree on the media used.
      </p>

      <h2>RESTful API Design</h2>

      <p>
        The API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface through which developers interact with data from an application.
        If an API is not well designed and so confusing or not verbose, then developers may stop using it.
        Even if you are not writing APIs for other developers and products, it is always good for your application to have well designed APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are the most important terms related to REST APIs:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Resource</b>: An object or representation of something, which has some associated data with it and there can be set of methods to operate on it.
            E.g.  Companies, Animals, schools and employees are resources and delete, add, update are the operations to be performed on these resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Collections</b>:  set of resources, e.g Companies is the collection of Company resource.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</b> a path through which a resource can be located and some actions can be performed on it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are the most important  HTTP methods (verbs):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>GET</b>: requests data from the resource and should not produce any side effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>POST</b>: method requests the server to create a resource in the database. It is <b>non-idempotent</b> which means multiple requests will have different effects
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PUT</b>: method requests the server to update resource or create the resource, if it doesn’t exist. It is <b>idempotent</b> which means multiple requests will have the same effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>DELETE</b>: method requests that the resources, or its instance, should be removed from the database.
          </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        When designing an API, URL paths should contain the plural form of resources (nouns, not actions or verbs)
        and the HTTP method should define the kind of action to be performed on the resource.
        If we want to access one instance of the resource, we can always pass the id in the URL.
        <br /><br />
        For example, say we had an application that has the resource Company:
        <ul>
          <li>
            method <b>GET</b> path <b>/companies</b> should get the list of all companies
          </li>
          <li>
            method <b>GET</b> path <b>/companies/34</b> should get the detail of company 34
          </li>
          <li>
            method <b>DELETE</b> path <b>/companies/34</b> should delete company 34
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        If we have resources under a resource, e.g Employees of a Company, then few of the sample API endpoints would be:
        <ul>
          <li>
            method <b>GET</b> path <b>/companies/3/employees</b> should get the list of all employees from company 3
          </li>
          <li>
            method <b>GET</b> path <b>/companies/3/employees/45</b> should get the details of employee 45, which belongs to company 3
          </li>
          <li>
            method <b>DELETE</b> path <b>/companies/3/employees/45</b> should delete employee 45, which belongs to company 3
          </li>
          <li>
            method <b>POST</b> path <b>/companies</b> should create a new company and return the details of the new company created
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        When the client raises a request to the server through an API, the client should know the feedback, whether it failed,
        passed or the request was wrong. HTTP status codes are standardized codes with various meanings. The server should always return the right status code.
        <br /><br />
        <b>2xx (Success category)</b>:
        <br />
        <b>200 Ok:</b>  The standard HTTP response representing success for GET, PUT or POST.
        <br />
        <b>201 Created:</b>  This status code should be returned whenever the new instance is created.
        <br />
        <b>204 No Content:</b>  represents the request is successfully processed, but has not returned any content. DELETE can be a good example of this.
        <br /><br />
        <b>3xx (Redirection Category)</b>:
        <br />
        <b>304 Not Modified</b> indicates that the client has the response already in its cache. And hence there is no need to transfer the same data again.
        <br /><br />
        <b>4xx (Client Error Category)</b>:
        <br />
        <b>400 Bad Request</b> indicates that the request by the client was not processed, as the server could not understand what the client is asking for.
        <br />
        <b>401 Unauthorized</b> indicates that the client is not allowed to access resources, and should re-request with the required credentials.
        <br />
        <b>403 Forbidden</b> indicates that the request is valid and the client is authenticated, but the client is not allowed access the page or resource for any reason.
        <br />
        <b>404 Not Found</b> indicates that the requested resource is not available now.
        <br />
        <b>410 Gone</b> indicates that the requested resource is no longer available which has been intentionally moved.
        <br /><br />
        <b>5xx (Server Error Category)</b>:
        <br />
        <b>500 Internal Server Error</b> indicates that the request is valid, but the server is totally confused.
        <br />
        <b>503 Service Unavailable</b> indicates that the server is down or unavailable to receive and process the request.
      </p>

      <h1>PostCSS</h1>
      <p>
        PostCSS is a tool for processing CSS with JavaScript plugins. There are currently more than 200 plugins for PostCSS, many of which are listed on the PostCSS GitHub page.
        PostCSS can be integrated in most the build tools including Gulp, Grunt, webpack or npm.
        <br /><br />


      </p>




      <h2>PostCSS AutoPrefixer</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> is one of the most popular PostCSS plugins.
        It is a CSS post processor that goes through (compiled) CSS files and
        adds or removes vendor prefixes after checking the code against <a href="https://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a>.
        This means that you don’t have to write any vendor prefixes while writing CSS code.
        <br /><br />

        Vendor prefixes are a way for browser makers to add support for newer CSS features that are still being experimented with.
        Once testing is done, browser makers will automatically remove the need for prefixes for that particular CSS property.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a>
        By default, Autoprefixer will support the 2 latest versions of major browsers but you can easily set which browsers and versions to support in the configuration file.
      </p>
      <pre>
a {
  background: linear-gradient(to top, black, white);
  display: flex
}

Is Transformed To:

a {
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, black, white);
  background: linear-gradient(to top, black, white);
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -moz-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex
}

      </pre>

      <h2>Gulp and PostCSS</h2>
      <p>
        Below is an example of how PostCSS can be used with Gulp.
      </p>

      <pre>
// gulpfile.js
var cssnano = require('cssnano');
var postcss = require('gulp-postcss');
var gulp = require('gulp');
var autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer');

gulp.task('serve', ['css'], function() {
    gulp.watch("./css/*.css", ['css']);
});

gulp.task('css', function() {
    var plugin = [
        autoprefixer(),
        cssnano()
    ];
    return gulp.src('./css/*.css')
        .pipe(postcss(plugin))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./dest'));
});

gulp.task('default', ['serve']);

      </pre>

      <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
      <p>
        A Browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box when laying out a document.
        <br /><br />
        CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.
        Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

      </p>
      <img src="images/css_box_model.png" alt="CSS Box Model" />
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The <b>content area</b> is bounded by the content edge and contains the "real" content of the element
        such as text or an image. It can have a background colour or image. The content area's size are defined
        with width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties.
        <br /><br />
        <b>box-sizing: content-box;</b> is the default in the CSS box model. The width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content area.
        If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content area will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width.
        If <b>box-sizing: border-box;</b> is set, this tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for width and height.
        So If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width.
        <br /><br />
        The <b>padding area</b> is bounded by the padding edge. The thickness of the padding is determined by the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left, and shorthand padding properties.
        <br /><br />
        The <b>border area</b> is bounded by the border edge. The thickness of the borders are determined by the border-width and shorthand border properties.
        If the box-sizing property is set to border-box, the border area's size can be explicitly defined with the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties.
        <br /><br />
        The <b>margin area</b>, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors.
        Its dimensions are the margin-box width and the margin-box height.
        The size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and shorthand margin properties.
        When margin collapsing occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.

      <h1>Less.js</h1>
      <p>
        Less.js is a CSS pre-processor with a CSS-like syntax.
      </p>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        Variables allow commonly used values to be controlled from a single location.
      </p>
      <pre>
// Variables
@link-color:        #428bca; // sea blue
@link-color-hover:  darken(@link-color, 10%);
@my-selector:       banner;
@images:            "../img";
@themes:            "../../src/themes";
@property:          color;


// Usage

@import "@{themes}/tidal-wave.less";

a,
.link {
  color: @link-color;
}
a:hover {
  color: @link-color-hover;
}
.widget {
  color: #fff;
  background: @link-color;
}

// the below compiles to .banner{
.@{my-selector} {
  font-weight: bold;
  line-height: 40px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

body {
  color: #444;
  background: url("@{images}/white-sand.png");
}

.widget {
  @{property}: #0ee; // compiles to color: #0ee;
  background-@{property}: #999;
}

      </pre>

      <h2>Nested Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Nesting allows you to cascade your CSS properties with inheriting children where <b>&</b> operator represents the parent selectors of a nested rule.
        <br /><br />Below is an example of a nested rule and what it will compile to:
      </p>
      <pre>
// Variables
// ---------

@textColor: #232323;
@textHighlight: #00214D;
@fontFamily: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
@fontSize: 14px;
@lineHeight: 21px;

@introSize: 16px;
@introLineHeight: 24px;
@introFontVariant: small-caps;

// LESS for Paragraph
// ------------------

p {
	color: @textColor;
	font-family: @fontFamily;
	font-size: @fontSize;
	line-height: @lineHeight;

	.intro {
		font-variant: @introFontVariant;
		font-size: @introSize;
		line-height: @introLineHeight;
	} // End of .intro class

	.highlight {
		color: @textHighlight;
		font-weight: bold;
	} // End of .highlight class

} // End of paragraph rule

// Gets compiled to the following:
p {
  color: #222222;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 21px;
}
p .intro {
  font-variant: small-caps;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 24px;
}
p .highlight {
  color: #00214d;
  font-weight: bold;
}

      </pre>

      <h3>Using &</h3>

      <p>
        In the above example, if the CSS needs to read <b>p.intro</b> instead of <b>p .intro</b>, an ampersand (&) can be added prior to your nested rule.
        (when you want to target a <b>.intro</b> that is a paragraph element  instead of targetting a <b>.intro</b> that is a descendant of a <b>paragraph</b> element).
      </p>
      <pre>
// LESS for Paragraph
// ------------------

p {
	color: @textColor;
	font-family: @fontFamily;
	font-size: @fontSize;
	line-height: @lineHeight;

	&.intro {
		font-variant: @introFontVariant;
		font-size: @introSize;
		line-height: @introLineHeight;
	}

	.highlight {
		color: @textHighlight;
		font-weight: bold;
	}

}

// Results in the below when compiled
p {
  color: #222222;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 21px;
}
p.intro {
  font-variant: small-caps;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 24px;
}
p .highlight {
  color: #00214d;
  font-weight: bold;
}

      </pre>

      <p>
        <b>&</b> is also used to assign pseudo-classes, like <b>:hover</b>
      </p>

      <pre>
@link-color: #999;
@link-hover: #229ed3;

ul {
    margin: 0;

    li {
        float: left;
    }

    a {
        color: @link-color;

        &:hover {
            color: @link-hover;
        }
    }
}

//compiles to
ul { margin: 0; }
ul li { float: left; }
ul a { color: #999; }
ul a:hover { color: #229ed3; }

      </pre>

      <h2>Mixins</h2>
      <p>
        We can use Mixins to reuse whole declarations in a CSS rule set in another rule set.
      </p>
      <pre>
// Variables
@baseFontSize: 14px;
@baseLineHeight: 21px;

.serif {
	font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
}

p {
	font-size: @baseFontSize;
	line-height: @baseLineHeight;
	.serif;
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Gets compiled to the following:
      </p>
      <pre>
.serif {
  font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
}

p {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 21px;
  font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
}

      </pre>

      <h3>Parametric Mixins</h3>
      <p>
        Parametric Mixins can accept parameters.
      </p>
      <pre>

.bordered (@width) {
    border: @width solid #ddd;

    &:hover {
        border-color: #999;
    }
}

h1 {
    .bordered(5px);
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Gets compiled to:
      </p>
      <pre>
h1 { border: 5px solid #ddd; }
h1:hover { border-color: #999; }
      </pre>

      <h3>elements.less</h3>
      <p>
        If you are using CSS3 a lot in your website, you can use LESS Elements to make your job much easier.
        LESS Elements is a collection of common CSS3 Mixins that we may use often in stylesheets, such as border-radius, gradients, drop-shadow and so on.
        To use LESS Elements, simply add the @import rule in your LESS stylesheet after downloading it and adding it into your working directory.
      </p>

      <pre>
@import "elements.less";

div {
  .rounded(3px);
}

      </pre>

      <h2>Operations</h2>
      <p>
        Less can bring math and calculations to your CSS. You can do operations on the numbers, colours and variables.
      </p>
      <pre>
// Number
h1 {
    margin-bottom: 10px - 5px;
    margin-bottom: 10px - 5;
}

// Color
h1 {
    color: #888888 / 2;
}

// Variable
@h1-default-margin-bottom:  25px;
h1.tight {
    margin-bottom: @h1-default-margin-bottom - 10px
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Below are some colour functions built into Less.
      </p>

      <pre>
lighten(@color, 10%);     // return a color which is 10% *lighter* than @color
darken(@color, 10%);      // return a color which is 10% *darker* than @color

saturate(@color, 10%);    // return a color 10% *more* saturated than @color
desaturate(@color, 10%);  // return a color 10% *less* saturated than @color

fadein(@color, 10%);      // return a color 10% *less* transparent than @color
fadeout(@color, 10%);     // return a color 10% *more* transparent than @color
fade(@color, 50%);        // return @color with 50% transparency

spin(@color, 10);         // return a color with a 10 degree larger in hue than @color
spin(@color, -10);        // return a color with a 10 degree smaller hue than @color

mix(@color1, @color2);    // return a mix of @color1 and @color2

      </pre>
      <p>
        For a ful list of functions available in Less, visit <a href="http://lesscss.org/functions/">http://lesscss.org/functions/ </a>
      </p>


      <h2>Extends</h2>
      <p>
        Extends are useful for sharing a generic definition with selectors rather than copying it in.
        <br /><br />
        The following:
      </p>
      <pre>
.block { margin: 10px 5px; }

p {
  &:extend(.block);
  border: 1px solid #eee;
}

ul, ol {
  &:extend(.block);
  color: #333;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

      </pre>
      <p>
        Gets compiled into the following:
      </p>
      <pre>
.block, p, ul, ol { margin: 10px 5px; }

p { border: 1px solid #eee; }
ul, ol { color: #333; text-transform: uppercase; }

      </pre>

      <h1>ES6 Promises</h1>
      <p>
        Promises give us a way to handle asynchronous processing in a more synchronous fashion.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating Promises</h3>
      <p>
        Promises are created by using the promise constructor which takes one argument, a callback function.
        <br /><br />
        The callback function can take two handler arguments, one is typically named <code><b>resolve</b></code>, which is called if everything worked as expected,
        and the other is typically named <code><b>reject</b></code> if not.
        <br /><br />
        A Promise can have one of the following three states:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pending</b> - until a Promise is fulfilled, it is in the pending state</li>
          <li><b>Fulfilled</b> - when the first handler is called the Promise is considered fulfilled with the value passed to that handler.</li>
          <li><b>Rejected</b> - if the second handler is called, the Promise is considered rejected with the value passed to that handler.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Processing Promises</h3>
      <p>
        To process (consume) a Promise, we use its <b>.then()</b> method. This method takes two possible handler parameters. The first is the function called
        if the Promise is fulfilled and the second is called if the Promise is rejected.
        <br /><br />
        A Promise can only be 'settled' (fulfilled or rejected) once. Other consumers can not change the settled value.
      </p>

      <h3>Example Using readFile</h3>

      <pre>
import {readFile} from 'fs';

function readFilePromisified(filename) {
    return new Promise(
        function (resolve, reject) {
            readFile(filename, { encoding: 'utf8' },
                (error, data) => {
                    if (error) {
                        reject(error);
                    } else {
                        resolve(data);
                    }
                });
        });
}

readFilePromisified() is used like this:

readFilePromisified(process.argv[2])
.then(text => {
    console.log(text);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
});

      </pre>

      <h3>Example Using XMLHttpRequest</h3>
      <pre>
function get(url) {
  // Return a new promise.
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Do the usual XHR stuff
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('GET', url);

    req.onload = function() {
      // This is called even on 404 etc
      // so check the status
      if (req.status == 200) {
        // Resolve the promise with the response text
        resolve(req.response);
      }
      else {
        // Otherwise reject with the status text
        // which will hopefully be a meaningful error
        reject(Error(req.statusText));
      }
    };

    // Handle network errors
    req.onerror = function() {
      reject(Error("Network Error"));
    };

    // Make the request
    req.send();
  });
}

//Now let's use it:

get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error("Failed!", error);
});

      </pre>

      <h3>Promise.all and Promise.race</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Promise.all</b> is a way for running an array of Promises concurrently. Note that even if a single dependency is rejected, the Promise.all method will be rejected entirely as well.
        If all promises are resolved, correctly <b>Promise.all</b> triggers its <b>then</b> handler with an array of resolved values in the same order as promises passed in.
      </p>
      <pre>
// list of files we want to read from disk
let filenames = ['index.html', 'blog.html', 'terms.html'];

Promise.all(filenames.map(readFilePromise))
  .then(files => {
    console.log('index:', files[0]);
    console.log('blog:', files[1]);
    console.log('terms:', files[2]);
})

      </pre>

      <p>
        <b>Promise.race</b> is similar to <b>Promise.all</b> but will return once <b>ANY</b> of the Promises resolves or rejects,
        discarding all the other results. This could be useful for scenarios where we want to time out a promise we otherwise have no control over.
      </p>

      <pre>
var p = Promise.race([
  fetch('/resource-that-may-take-a-while'),
  new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('request timeout')), 5000)
  })
])
p.then(response => console.log(response))
p.catch(error => console.log(error))

      </pre>

      <h1>JavaScript Objects and Prototypes</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties, and methods.
        <br /><br />
        Every JavaScript Object has a prototype which they inherit the properties and methods from. All JavaScript objects inherit from the Object.prototype.
        The standard way to create an object prototype is to use an Object Constructor function:
      </p>
      <pre>
// It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}

//With a constructor function, you can use the new keyword to create new objects from the same prototype:
var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

      </pre>

      <p>
        The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to an existing prototype:
      </p>
      <pre>
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";

Person.prototype.name = function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

      </pre>

      <h1>Hoisting</h1>
      <p>
        During compilation, var and function declarations are "moved" to the top of their respective scopes. This behaviour is called hoisting.
        <br /><br />
        This means declared functions can be called before it is defined. Function expressions are not hoisted and are only
        usable after they are created when the execution reaches it.
        <br /><br />
        var declarations are hoisted but not their assignments. let and const are not hoisted.
      </p>
      <pre>
// only 'var g' is hoisted, not its assignment
var g = 34;

// function declaration are hoisted
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// function expression are not hoisted, only 'var sum' is hoisted
var sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

        Primatives, like null, undefined , boolean, number, string  are assigned by value-copy. Compound values (objects, which includes arrays, and functions),
        always create a copy of the reference on assignment.

      <h1>ES6 Modules</h1>
      <p>
        ES6 specification sees the introduction of built-in module support.
        <br /><br />
        ES6 modules are stored in files with one module per file /one file per module.
        <br /><br />
        Modules are singletons; even if a module is imported multiple times, only a single  'instance' of it exists.
      </p>
      <h2>Named Exports</h2>
      <p>
        A module can export multiple things by prefixing its declarations with the keyword <b>export</b>:
      </p>
      <pre>
export const sqrt = Math.sqrt;
export function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
export function diag(x, y) {
    return sqrt(square(x) + square(y));
}

//------ main.js ------
import { square, diag } from 'lib';
console.log(square(11)); // 121
console.log(diag(4, 3)); // 5
      </pre>
      <p>
        You can also import the whole module:
      </p>
      <pre>
import * as lib from 'lib';
console.log(lib.square(11)); // 121
console.log(lib.diag(4, 3)); // 5
      </pre>

      <p>
        The same code in CommonJS
      </p>
      <pre>
/------ lib.js ------
var sqrt = Math.sqrt;
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
function diag(x, y) {
    return sqrt(square(x) + square(y));
}
module.exports = {
    sqrt: sqrt,
    square: square,
    diag: diag,
};

//------ main.js ------
var square = require('lib').square;
var diag = require('lib').diag;
console.log(square(11)); // 121
console.log(diag(4, 3)); // 5
      </pre>

      <h2>Default Exports</h2>
      <p>
        An ES6 module can pick a <b>default export</b>:
      </P>
      <pre>
Default Function Export:

//------ myFunc.js ------
export default function () {} // no semicolon!

//------ main1.js ------
import myFunc from 'myFunc';
myFunc();


Default Class Export:

//------ MyClass.js ------
export default class {} // no semicolon!

//------ main2.js ------
import MyClass from 'MyClass';
const inst = new MyClass();
      </pre>

      <p>
        In ES6, when you import modules, the import is resolved at compile time which allows the removal of exports
        that are not used by other modules (dead code elimination).
        <br /><br />
        ES6 uses a 'tree shaking ‘approach to dead code elimination where it only includes code that your bundle needs
        to run rather than excluding code the your bundle doesn't need. In ES6, when you import modules, the import is
        resolved at compile time which allows the removal of exports that are not used by other modules (dead code elimination).
      </p>
      <h2>Building ES6 modules</h2>
      <p>
        Most browsers do not implement loading of ES6 modules so they must be built.
        <br /><br />
        The most common approach for building/converting ES6 modules to work in the browser is to use a transpiler like
        Babel to transpile your ES6 code to ES5 code to  CommonJS, then pipe the transpiled code through a module bundler
        like Browserify or Webpack to create one or more bundled files.

      <h1>Website / Application Loading Performance</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Slow running websites and applications result in higher bounce rates (percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave), fewer return visits and frustrated users.
        <br /><br />
        In a <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters">DoubleClick by Google study</a>, it was found that 53% of mobile site visits were
        abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load. In the same study, it was found that sites loading within 5 seconds had 70% longer sessions, 35% lower bounce rates
        than sites taking nearly four times longer at 19 second and publishers whose sites loaded within five seconds earned up to twice as much ad revenue than sites loading within 19 seconds.
        <br /><br />
        Google has also implemented site speed as a ranking signal in its mobile searches so slow loading is detrimental for search engine optimization (SEO).
        <br /><br />
        With web site and application size and functionality now becoming more demanding of network and device resources, coupled with the fact that mobile users now making up the
        largest portion of internet users (many of who access the web through mobile LTE, 4G, 3G and even 2G networks), optimizing performance should be at the top of the list of
        priorities when developing web sites and applications.
        <br /><br />
        Below are outlined some techniques we can use to 'grab the low hanging fruits' to increase performance of our web sites and applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Minifying Your JavaScript, HTML and CSS Code</h2>
      <p>
        Minification removes unnecessary characters from code without changing its validity or functionality (things like comments, whitespace, newlines, and extra parentheses).
        There are quite a few plugins and apps that can be used. Below are some examples:
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-html-minifier">gulp-html-minifier</a> is a Gulp plugin that can be used to minify HTML.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel-minify">gulp-babel-minify</a> is a Gulp plugin that can be used to minify JavaScript.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css">gulp-clean-css</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cssnano">gulp-cssnano</a> are Gulp plugins that can be used to minify CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>Reduce Library Use</h2>
      <p>
        Although CSS and JavaScript libraries do their best to minify and compress their download files they can still consume serious bandwidth.
        If you only need one or two specific things, you can save a lot of download time by replacing those features with single-use functions or CSS rules.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">You might not need jQuery</a> is a site where you can find alternatives to jQuery code to get the same effects on your site
        without the download overhead of jQuery.
        <br /><br />
        CSS is a render blocking resource which means that the browser won't render any processed content until the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is constructed.
        Therefore it is important to keep your CSS as 'lean' as possible.
        <br /><br />
        If you are using Bootstrap, it may be worth looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout">Flexbox</a> and
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">Grid</a> as alternatives so you don't have the overhead of a CSS framework.

      <h2>Use Gzip</h2>
      <p>
        Gzipping text resources can achieve up to 70% compression (or more for larger files).
        All modern browsers support Gzip compression for HTTP requests but the server must be configured to deliver the compressed resource when requested.
        <br /><br />
        If this configuration is not possible, like for example your hosting company do not provide that option, then look into ways to add Gzipping to your code.
        <br /><br />
        In <a href="https://codeburst.io/how-i-decreased-the-size-of-my-heroku-app-by-75-1a4cf329b0ab">this article</a>, the author explains how he used
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/compression">expressjs/compression middleware</a> to decrease his JavaScript and CSS bundles.
      </p>


      <h2>Graphical Content</h2>
      <p>
        Graphical content can easily account for 60%-85% of a typical website's total bandwidth so by reducing the amount of time
        images take to load can lead to a significant performance boost.
      </p>
      <h3>Remove Unnecessary Images</h3>
      <p>
        Consider whether each image is really needed or whether it is needed straight away. Every image removed speeds up your page load time.
      </p>
      <h3>Choose Appropriate Image Types</h3>
      <p>
        As a rule of thumb, use PNGs for clip art, line drawings or wherever you need transparency, JPGs for photographs and GIFs for animation.
      </p>
      <h3>Remove Image Metadata</h3>
      <p>
        For most website images, metadata is unimportant so can be stripped out.
        Some image editors have functionality to view and edit metadata. There are also online tools such as  <a href="http://www.verexif.com/en/">VerExif</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Resize Images</h3>
      <p>
        Always size images on their intended use. You should not rely on the browser to resize them for rendering.
        Another effective technique is to reduce file size for images of all kinds is simple cropping to show only what's important.
      </p>
      <h3>Reduce image quality</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, you can reduce the quality of a JPG, and thus the file size, without suffering any visible quality difference.
        Experiment with lower-quality JPGs to see how low you can go before seeing a difference, and then use the smallest one that retains the photo's clarity.
      </p>
      <h3>Compress Images</h3>
      <p>
        PNG and JPG images can be squashed down even more using a compression tool, which reduces file size without affecting either image dimensions or visual quality.
        One such tool is <a href="https://tinypng.com">TinyPing</a>, a free online compression tool.
      </p>
      <h2>Reducing HTTP Requests</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to reducing download size, we can also reduce download frequency by combining resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Combine Text Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Web pages may have multiple JavaScript and Stylesheet files.
        Each file requires its own HTTP request so by combining files, we can speed up page loading.
        <br /><br />
        To combine JavaScript and Stylesheet files, things you could use include <b>Gulp with the plugin gulp-concat</b>, <b>Browserify</b>, and <b>Webpack</b>.
        <br /><br />
        Please note that CSS doesn't throw an error when a previously-defined property is reset by a more recent rule, so combining CSS files could cause issues.
        To overcome this,before concatenating, look for conflicting rules and determine whether one should always supersede the other,
        or if one should use more specific selectors to be applied properly.
      </p>

      <h3>Combine Graphical Resources</h3>
      <p>
        This technique is most commonly used with small images such as icons.
        <br /><br />
        You can combine small images into one file then use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp" >CSS background positioning</a> to display the desired part of
        the image (sprite) on the desired place on the page.
      </p>


      <h2>HTTP Caching</h2>
      <p>
        When a Browser first loads a web page, it stores the resources in the HTTP Cache. When the browser goes to the page on the next visit,
        it can look in the cache for those resources that were stored from the previous visit and retrieve them from disk, which is often faster than downloading from the network.
        <br /><br />
        Browsers may have multiple caches that differ in how they acquire, store, and retain content. You can read about how these caches vary in this excellent article,
        <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2016/a-tale-of-four-caches/">A Tale of Four Caches</a>.
        <br /><br />
        Caching works by categorizing certain page resources in terms of how frequently or infrequently they change. It is important to determine which types of content
        are more static or more dynamic.
        <br /><br />
        You can find a great discussion of caching patterns, options, and potential pitfalls in
        <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices"> Caching Best Practices and Max-age Gotchas</a>.

      <h2>Tools To Measure Performance</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> is an excellent tool for testing on real mobile devices and envisioning a more real-world setup.
        You give it a URL, it loads the page on a real Moto G4 device with a slow 3G connection, and then gives you a detailed report on the page's load performance.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Chrome DevTools</b> (built into Google Chrome) provides in-depth analysis on everything that happens while your page loads or runs.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Lighthouse</b> is available in Chrome DevTools, as a Chrome Extension, as a Node.js module, and within WebPageTest.
        You give it a URL, it simulates a mid-range device with a slow 3G connection, runs a series of audits on the page, and then
        gives you a report on load performance, as well as suggestions on how to improve.
        <br /><br />
        Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools are primarily for your local iteration as you build your site.

      <h1>Closures</h1>
      <p>
        A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent scope has been closed. A closure is not only the function, but also the environment in which the function was created.
        <br />Imagine if we had the following function:
      </p>
      <pre>
function speak() {
  return function logIt() {
    var words = 'hi';
    console.log(words);
  }
}


var sayHello = speak();

      </pre>
      <p>
        If we take a look at what sayHello variable is referencing we get the following:
      </p>

      <pre>
console.log(sayHello);

// Returns:
//  function logIt() {
//	var words = 'hi';
//    	console.log(words);
//  }

      </pre>

      <p>If we invoke the function <b>sayHello</b> we get <b>hi</b> returned as expected:</p>

      <pre>
sayHello();
// returns hi

      </pre>
      <p>Imagine if we change the function to the following:</p>


      <pre>
function speak() {
  var words = 'hi';
  return function logIt() {
    console.log(words);
  }
}


var sayHello = speak();

      </pre>

      <p>If we take a look at what sayHello variable is referencing we get the following:</p>

      <pre>
console.log(sayHello);

// Returns:
//  function logIt() {
//    console.log(words);
//  }

      </pre>

      <p>
        Notice that there is no <b>words</b> variable. However, if we invoke the function <b>sayHello</b> we still get <b>hi</b> returned:
      </p>
      <pre>
sayHello();
// returns hi
      </pre>

      <p>
      	sayHello() is a closure object that consists of the logIt() function and the environment variables that existed when the closure was created, including the message variable.
      	<br /><br />
        The inner function has three <b>scope chains</b>. The first chain allows the inner function to access its own variables.
        The second allows it to access the variables and parameters of the outer function. And the third allows it to access the global variables.

      <h1>Call, Apply and Bind</h1>
      <p>
        Call, Apply and Bind are function methods that allow you to change the value of <b>'this'</b> for a given function.
      </p>

      <h2>call() and apply()</h2>
      <p>
        Call and Apply are invoked immediately. Call takes any number of parameters: <b>'this'</b>, followed by the additional arguments.
        Apply takes only two parameters: <b>'this'</b>, followed by an array of the additional arguments.
        <br /><br />
        In the below example, when we use <b>add.call()</b> the first parameter is what <b>'this'</b> should be bound to.
        The subsequent parameters are passed into the function we are calling. Thus, in <b>add()</b>, this.a refers to ten.a and this.b refers to ten.b and we get 1+2+3+4 returned, or 10.
        <br /><br />
        <b>add.apply()</b> is similar. The first parameter is what <b>'this'</b> should be bound to. The subsequent parameter is an array of arguments to be used in the function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <pre>
function add(c, d) {
  console.log(this.a + this.b + c + d);
}

var ten = {a: 1, b: 2};

add.call(ten, 3, 4);
// logs => 10

add.apply(ten, [3,4]);
// logs => 10

      </pre>

      <h2>bind()</h2>
      <p>
        With bind() the parameters are identical to call() but bind() is not invoked immediately. Instead, bind() returns a function with the context of <b>'this'</b> bound
        already. Because of this, bind() is useful when we don’t know all of our arguments up front.
      </p>
      <br />
      <pre>
var small = {
  a: 1,
  go: function(b,c,d){
    console.log(this.a+b+c+d);
  }
}

var large = {
  a: 100
}

// small.go is called normally
small.go(2,3,4);
// logs 1+2+3+4 => 10

// if we want to use large.a we can use call()
small.go.call(large,2,3,4);
// logs 100+2+3+4 => 109

// if we don't know what the other two arguments are yet we can use bind
var bindTest = small.go.bind(large,2);

// we can call it later with the other two arguments
bindTest(3,4);
// logs 100+2+3+4 => 109

      <h1>Callbacks And Higher-Order Functions</h1>
      <p> A <b>callback</b> function is a function that is passed to another function <b>(higher-order function)</b> as an argument and can be executed or returned
          later by the higher-order function. When a callback function is passed as an argument, only the function definition is passed. The function the function is not executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, the callback is executed at some point inside the containing function’s body just as if the callback were defined
        in the containing function.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the callback is a closure. Closures have access to the containing function’s scope, so the callback function can access the containing function's
        variables, and even the variables from the global scope.
      </p>

      <p>The below is a quick example:</p>
      <pre>
function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);

      </pre>

      <p>JQuery uses callback functions extensively. Below is an example:</p>

      <pre>
//The item in the click method's parameter is a callback function, not a variable.​
$("#btn_1").click(function() {
  alert("Btn 1 Clicked");
});

      </pre>


      <h2>Asynchronous Callbacks</h2>


      <p>Callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed.</p>

      <p>Consider the code below:</p>

      <pre>

function first(){
  console.log(1);
}

function second(){
  console.log(2);
}

      </pre>
      <p>If we invoke our functions we get the following:</p>

      <pre>
first();
second();

// 1
// 2

      </pre>

      <p>
        However, what if function <b>first</b> contains code that can't be executed straight way?
        For example, an API request where we have to send the request then wait for a response?
        <br /><br />
        The below simulates this action:
      </p>

      <pre>
function first(){
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log(1);
  }, 500 );
}

function second(){
  console.log(2);
}

      </pre>

      <p>We get the following when we invoke our functions:</p>

      <pre>
first();
second();

// 2
// 1

      </pre>

      <p>
        So even though we invoked the <b>first()</b> function first, the result got logged out after that of the <b>second()</b> function.
        <br /><br />

        JavaScript didn’t wait for a response from first() before moving on to execute second().
        You can’t just call one function after another and hope they execute in the right order.
        Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.
      </p>

      <pre>
function first(callback){

  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log(1);

    //execute callback
     callback();
  }, 1000 );
}

function second(){
  console.log(2);
}


      </pre>

      <p>We now get the following when we invoke our functions:</p>

      <pre>
first(second);

// 1
// 2

      </pre>

      <p>
        The use of Callback functions is useful for HTTP requests (like making an AJAX request) where you need to do
        something with the response where you can use a callback function to handle the response whenever it arrives.<br /><br />
        Another useful example in this context could be when your application is dependent on user input or when reading
        from files or when downloading things.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the below example, <b>T.get</b> simply means we are making a get request to Twitter.
        There are three parameters in this request: ‘search/tweets’, which is the route of our request, params
        which are our search parameters, and then an anonymous function which is our callback.

      <pre>
T.get('search/tweets', params, function(err, data, response) {
  if(!err){
    // This is where the magic will happen
  } else {
    console.log(err);
  }
})
      </pre>

      <p>
        A callback is important here because we need to wait for a response from the server before we can move forward in our code.
        We don’t know if our API request is going to be successful or not so after sending our parameters to search/tweets via a get
        request, we wait. <br /><br />

        Once Twitter responds, our callback function is invoked. Twitter will either send an err
        (error) object or a response object back to us. <br /><br />

        In our callback function we can use an if() statement to determine
        if our request was successful or not, and then act upon the new data accordingly.
      </p>

      <h1>JavaScript Modules</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Modules help developers separate functionality and organize the codebase. Also without modules JavaScript's
        global namespace can become easily polluted.
        <br /><br />
        Functions are the only thing in JavaScript that create a new scope; thus anything not declared within a
        function is apart of the global namespace.
        <br /><br />
        Thus every function we declare in JavaScript is available globally and therefore its name cannot be used again.
        Often this leads to a polluted namespace where names and code can be difficult to find and reuse.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes we don’t want that function to be available everywhere.
        In order to make functions in one JavaScript file available to just a single other JavaScript file, we can use modules.
        <br /><br />
        There is no native support for a modules system in ES5.
        Fortunately there are non native ways to <i>emulate</i> a modules system.
        Two of the popular ones are CommonJS whose syntax will be familiar to those who work in the Node.JS ecosystem, and
        AMD (Asynchronous module definition).
      </p>
      <h2>CommonJS</h2>
      <p>
        A CommonJS module is essentially a reusable piece of JavaScript which <b>exports</b> specific objects,
        making them available for other modules to require in their programs.
        <br /><br />
        With CommonJS, each JavaScript file stores modules in its own unique module context (just like wrapping it in a closure).
        In this scope, we use the <b>module.exports</b> object to expose modules, and <b>require</b> to import them.
        <br /><br />
        Below is an example CommonJS module in a file called <b>myModule.js</b>
      </p>
      <pre>
function myModule() {
this.hello = function() {
  return 'hello!';
}

this.goodbye = function() {
  return 'goodbye!';
}
}

module.exports = myModule;

      </pre>

      <p>
        If <i>myModule</i> needs to be used, you can <i>require</i> it in your file:
      </p>

      <pre>
var myModule = require('myModule');

var myModuleInstance = new myModule();
myModuleInstance.hello(); // 'hello!'
myModuleInstance.goodbye(); // 'goodbye!'

      </pre>

      <h2>Module Bundling</h2>
      <p>
        If you are using non-native module systems like CommonJS (which browsers can't interpret),
        you will need to use a specialized tool to convert your modules into properly-ordered browser-friendly code.
        <br /><br />
        Also another issue with using CommonJS is that it loads modules synchronously.
        This will be an issue in the browser as the browser will be blocked from running anything else until it finishes loading modules.
        <br /><br />
        To get around these issues, we must <b>"bundle"</b> the modules.
        Module bundling is the process of concatenating a group of modules and their dependencies into a single file
        (or group of files) in the correct order, in order to reduce the number of browser requests.
        <br /><br />
        Two of the most popular options are <b>Browserify</b> and <b>Webpack</b>. Please see section on Module Bundling.
      </p>

      <h3>Browserify</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the below main.js file that requires (imports) a module 'myDependency'
      </p>
      <pre>
var myDependency = require(‘myDependency’);

var myGrades = [93, 95, 88, 0, 91];

var myAverageGrade = myDependency.average(myGrades);

      </pre>
      <p>
        We have one dependency. Using the command below, Browserify recursively bundles up all the required module(s),
        in the correct order, starting at main.js into a single file called bundle.js:
      </p>

      <pre>
browserify main.js -o bundle.js

      </pre>

      <p>
        All you have to do is insert a single <b>script</b> tag with your bundle.js  file into your html to ensure
        that all of your source code is downloaded in one HTTP request.
        <br /><br />
        If you have multiple files with multiple dependencies, you simply tell Browserify what your entry file is.
        <br /><br />
        The final step would be Minification of the bundled code which is the process of removing unnecessary characters
        from source code e.g. whitespace, comments, new line characters, etc., in order to reduce the overall size of
        the content without changing the functionality of the code.
      </p>

      <h3>Webpack</h3>

      <p>
        Webpack is another bundler that can be used. Webpack provides some useful features like code splitting,
         a way to split your codebase into chunks which are loaded on demand.
        <br /><br />
        For example, if you have a web app with blocks of code that are only required under certain circumstances,
        it might not be efficient to put the whole codebase into a single massive bundled file.
        In this case, you could use code splitting to extract code into bundled chunks that can be loaded on demand,
        avoiding trouble with big up-front payloads when most users only need the core of your application.
      </p>

      <h1>ES6 Const And Let Variables</h1>

      <p>Scope refers to where in your program your variables are visible.</p>

      <p><b>Let</b> and <b>Const</b> Variables have block scope (surrounded by {}) and can't be used before declaration.</p>

      <p><b>Var</b> variables have function scope and are hoisted to the top which means can be used before it has been declared.</p>

      <pre>
function f() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;
  {
    var x = 100;
    let y = 200;
    const z = 300;
    console.log('x in block scope is', x); // x in block scope is 100
    console.log('y in block scope is', y); // y in block scope is 200
    console.log('z in block scope is', z); // z in block scope is 300
  }
  console.log('x outside of block scope is', x); // x outside of block scope is 100
  console.log('y outside of block scope is', y); // y outside of block scope is 2
  console.log('z outside of block scope is', z); // z outside of block scope is 3
}

f();


  </pre>

  <p><b>Const</b> variables need to be declared using an initializer, or it will generate an error. They also cannot be reassigned entirely to a different value. </p>

<pre>
const i = 0;
i = 1; //  TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
</pre>

        <p>However, if the value of a <b>const</b> is an object or array, the object’s properties themselves are still mutable, i.e. they are able to be modified.</p>

<pre>
const obj = {
  i: 0
};
obj.i = 1;
console.log(obj.i); // 1

            <h1>ES6 Arrow Functions</h1>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter function syntax and non-binding of <b>'this'</b>. It is important to note that
                arrow functions cannot be used as constructors as other functions can.
            </P>

            <h3>Shorter Function Syntax</h3>

            <p>Consider the following function</p>
            <pre>
function funcName(param1, param2) {
   return param1 + param2;
 }

funcName(2, 2);
// returns 4

            </pre>
            <p>Using the new arrow function syntax, it can now be written in the following way:</p>

            <pre>
var funcName = (param1, param2) => { param1 + param2 };

funcName(2, 2);
// returns 4
            </pre>

            <p>If a function has only one parameter, the parenthesis are optional:</p>

            <pre>
function funcName(param1) {
   return param1 + 2;
 }

funcName(2);
// returns 4

// With arrow function:
var funcName = param1 => { param1 + 2 };

funcName(2);
// returns 4

// It can also be written like the following as we are returning an expression:
var funcName = param1 => param1 + 2 ;

funcName(2);
//returns 4

            </pre>

            <p>The paramter list for a function with no parameters shouldbe written with a pair of parenthesis:</p>

            <pre>
() => { statements };
            </pre>

            <P>The body of the function should be parenthesized if it is returning an object literal expression</p>
            <pre>
params => ({foo: bar});
            </pre>


            <h3>No Binding Of <b>'This'</b></h3>

            <p>
                An arrow function does not bind <b>'this'</b>. Arrows instead bind <b>'this'</b> to the immediate enclosing lexical scope.
                Therefore, you don’t need <b>bind()</b> or <b>that = this</b>, anymore.
                <br /><br />
                Consider the following, in non-strict mode, the growUp() function defines <b>'this'</b> as the global object,
                which is different from the <b>'this'</b> defined by the Person() constructor. In strict mode, this is undefined.
            </p>

            <pre>
function Person() {
  // The Person() constructor defines `this` as an instance of itself.
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(function growUp() {
    this.age++;
    console.log(this.age)
  }, 1000);
}

var p = new Person();
// The above will return NaN every 1000 milliseconds because
// the growUp() function defines `this` as the global object

            </pre>

            <p>In ECMAScript 3/5, the <b>'this'</b> issue was fixable by assigning the value in <b>'this'</b> to a variable that could be closed over.</p>

            <pre>
function Person() {
  var that = this;
  that.age = 0;

  setInterval(function growUp() {
    // The callback refers to the `that` variable of which
    // the value is the expected object.
    that.age++;
    console.log(that.age);
  }, 1000);
}

var p = new Person();
// The above will return a number incremented by 1 every second.

            </pre>

            <p>
                An arrow function does not have its own <b>'this'</b>; the <b>'this'</b> value of the enclosing execution context is used.
                Thus, in the following code, the this within the function that is passed to setInterval has the same value as <b>'this'</b> in the enclosing function:
            </p>

            <pre>
function Person(){
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(() => {
    this.age++; // |this| properly refers to the person object
    console.log(this.age);
  }, 1000);
}

var p = new Person();
// The above will return a number incremented by 1 every second.

            </pre>

      <h1>ES6 Classes</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            It is important to note that JavaScript's 'Class' syntax in ES6 is little more than syntactic 'sugar over' for the existing prototype based behaviour.
            It simply provides a more convenient syntax for creating objects related via prototype linkage.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript's "classes" aren't like classes in languages like Java pr Python. In these class based languages you create classes which are templates for objects.
            <br /><br />
            When you want a new object, you instantiate the class, which tells the language engine to copy the methods and properties of the class into a new entity, called an instance.
            The instance is your object, and, after instantiation, has absolutely no active relation with the parent class.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Instantiating" a class in JavaScript does create a new object, but not one that is independent of its parent class.
            Rather, it creates an object that is linked to a prototype. Changes to that prototype propagate to the new object, even after instantiation.
        </p>

        <h3>Example Of Using Class Syntax</h3>

        <pre>
"use strict";

// Food is a base class
class Food {
  constructor (name, protein, carbs, fat) {
    this.name = name;
    this.protein = protein;
    this.carbs = carbs;
    this.fat = fat;
  }

  toString () {
    return `${this.name} | ${this.protein}g P :: ${this.carbs}g C :: ${this.fat}g F`
  }

  print () {
    console.log( this.toString() );
  }
}

const chicken_breast = new Food('Chicken Breast', 26, 0, 3.5);

chicken_breast.print(); // 'Chicken Breast | 26g P :: 0g C :: 3.5g F'

        </pre>

        <h3>Same thing using Constructor Function</h3>

        <pre>
function Food(name, protein, carbs, fat) {
  this.name = name;
  this.protein = protein;
  this.carbs = carbs;
  this.fat = fat;
}

Food.prototype.toString = function toString () {
        return `${this.name} | ${this.protein}g P :: ${this.carbs}g C :: ${this.fat}g F`
}

Food.prototype.print = function print() {
      console.log( this.toString() );
}


const chicken_breast = new Food('Chicken Breast', 26, 0, 3.5);

chicken_breast.print(); // 'Chicken Breast | 26g P :: 0g C :: 3.5g F'

        </pre>

        <h3>Inheritance Using New ES6 Syntax</h3>

        <p>
          With the new syntax, subclasses are created with 'extend' and calling with 'super'
        </p>

        <pre>
"use strict";

// Food is a base class
class Food {
    constructor (name, protein, carbs, fat) {
        this.name = name;
        this.protein = protein;
        this.carbs = carbs;
        this.fat = fat;
    }

    toString () {
        return `${this.name} | ${this.protein}g P :: ${this.carbs}g C :: ${this.fat}g F`
    }

    print () {
      console.log( this.toString() );
    }
}

// FatFreeFood is a derived class
class FatFreeFood extends Food {
    constructor (name, protein, carbs) {
        super(name, protein, carbs, 0);
    }

    print () {
        super.print();
        console.log(`Would you look at that -- ${this.name} has no fat!`);
    }
}

const fat_free_yogurt = new FatFreeFood('Greek Yogurt', 16, 12);
fat_free_yogurt.print(); // 'Greek Yogurt | 26g P :: 16g C :: 0g F
                        //  Would you look at that -- Greek Yogurt has no fat!'

        </pre>

        <h3>The same thing pre ES6</h3>

        <pre>
function Food(name, protein, carbs, fat) {
        this.name = name;
        this.protein = protein;
        this.carbs = carbs;
        this.fat = fat;
}

Food.prototype.toString = function toString () {
        return `${this.name} | ${this.protein}g P :: ${this.carbs}g C :: ${this.fat}g F`
}

Food.prototype.print = function print() {
      console.log( this.toString() );

}

function FatFreeFood (name, protein, carbs, fat) {
	Food.call(this, name, protein, carbs, fat);
}

FatFreeFood.prototype = Object.create(Food.prototype);

FatFreeFood.prototype.print_message = function print_message() {
	console.log(`Would you look at that -- ${this.name} has no fat!`);
}

const fat_free_yogurt = new FatFreeFood('Greek Yogurt', 16, 12);
fat_free_yogurt.print();
fat_free_yogurt.print_message(); // 'Greek Yogurt | 26g P :: 16g C :: 0g F
                                //  Would you look at that -- Greek Yogurt has no fat!'

      <h1>Node.js</h1>
      <p>
        Node.js is basically a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime called V8.
        Its greatest advantage over other JS engines is the compiling of JS code to native machine code before executing it.
        <br /><br />
        Node.js uses a single threaded <b>event loop</b>. It takes all requests and then delegates most of the work to other system workers.
        There's something called a <b>Libuv</b> library which handles this work effectively with help from the OS kernel.
        When the background workers are done doing their work, they emit events to NodeJs callbacks registered on that event.
        <br /><br />
        For example, if Node.js has to read a file saved on the serbver, while the file system is reading the file,
        Node.js uses the idle time to handle other requests. When the file system is done, it tells Node to come and take the resource and send it to the browser.
        <br /><br />
        Node.js makes use of <b>callbacks</b> which are basically functions passed into other functions as arguments and are called when certain conditions occur.
        Even though NodeJS is a single threaded system, it is usually faster than multi-threaded systems.
        However NodeJS doesn't excel at operations that consume CPU. CPU intensive operations overload the main thread, which is the only thread in Node.js.
        Node.js is suited more for I/O tasks, like a web server.

      <h1>Express</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Connect is a module that delivers a set of wrappers around the Node.js low-level APIs.
        The Connect module uses a modular component called <b>middleware</b> which allows you to
        simply register your application logic to predefined HTTP requests.
        Connect middleware are basically a bunch of callback functions, which get executed when a HTTP request occurs.
        The middleware can then perform some logic, return a response, or call the next registered middleware.

        Express is a web framework that uses Connect's middleware architecture.
      </p>

      <h2>Routing in Express</h2>
      <p>
        Routing means assigning functions to respond to users requests.
        Routing in Express follows this basic format:
        <br /><br />
        app.VERB(‘path’, callback…);
        <br/>
        Where VERB is any of the get, post, put, delete verbs.

      <h1>Gulp</h1>
      <p>
        Gulp is a streaming build system which allows it to pipe and pass around data being manipulated or used by its plugins. The Gulp API contains 4 top level
        Functions:
        <br /><br />
        <b>gulp.task: </b>defines your tasks.<br />
        <b>gulp.src: </b>points to the files that are to be used. It uses  <b>.pipe</b> for chaining output into other plugins<br />
        <b>gulp.dest: </b>points to the output folder we want to write files to.<br />
        <b>gulp.watch: </b>tells Gulp to watch for changes to any of the defined files and re-runs the task specified.<br /><br />

        <b>Gulp Plumber</b> is a global listener to a tak and displays meaningful error messages. With tasks that have multiple pipes, we only need to call plumber once.

        Below is an example of a Gulp file:
        <pre>
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');
var plumber = require('gulp-plumber');


// Styles
gulp.task('styles', function() {
    gulp.src('sass/styles.scss')

      .pipe(plumber({ errorHandler: function(err) {
                notify.onError({
                    title: "Gulp error in " + err.plugin,
                    message:  err.toString()
                })(err);
      .pipe(sass())
      .pipe(autoprefixer('last 1 version', '> 1%', 'ie 8', 'ie 7'))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('css'));
});

// Watch the sass files
gulp.task('watch', function() {
    gulp.watch('sass/*.scss', ['styles']);
});

gulp.task('default', ['styles, watch']);

        </pre>

        Some of the most common taks Gulp is used for are the following:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Compressing image files</li>
          <li>Eliminating debugger and console statements from scripts</li>
          <li>Minifying, concatenating, and cleaning up CSS and JavaScript</li>
          <li>Linting code for errors</li>
          <li>Compiling LESS files</li>
          <li>Running unit tests</li>
          <li>Sending updates to a production server</li>
          <li>Updating databases</li>
        </ul>

        (notes on  Live Reload and Browser sync  with Gulp here please https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-quick-guide-to-using-livereload-with-gulp

      <h1>Yarn</h1>

      <p>
        Yarn is a package management tool developed by Facebook.
        <br /><br />
        Advantages of Yarn include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It takes packages from both NpmJS or Bower registries.
            </br /></br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Security:</b><br /> Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.
            </br /></br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Offline Mode:</b><br />
            If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without any internet connection. Packages installed using Yarn with yarn add packagename are stored
            on your disk so that during the next install, this package will be used instead of sending a HTTP request to download the package again from the registry.
            </br /></br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Parallel Installation</b><br />
            Whenever npm or Yarn needs to install a package, it carries out a series of tasks. In npm, these tasks are executed per package and sequentially, meaning it will
            wait for a package to be fully installed before moving on to the next. Yarn executes these tasks in parallel, increasing performance.

            <b>Lockfiles</b><br />
            The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every machine regardless of install order.
            Lockfiles lock the installed dependencies to a specific version, and ensure that every install results in the exact same file structure in node_modules across all machines.
            <br />
            After every install, upgrade or removal, yarn updates a yarn.lock file which keeps track of the exact package version installed in node_modules directory.
            This lockfile should be added to version control.
            </br /></br />
